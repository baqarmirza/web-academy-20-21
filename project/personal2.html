<h1>Loyalty!!</h1>
<h3>Loyalty is very importrant to me because it helps built foundations for relationship. Loyalty is valuable because it allows us to take the risk of predicting the actions and behavior of people we trust. being loyal hjelps with romantic relationshipas well and it helps develop love and trust. "Honesty and loyalty are key. If two people can be honest with each other about everything, that's probably the biggest key to success" is a quote I like about Taylor Lautner. </h3>
