<p> The second movie I will be talking about is the movie is called Train To Busan. Train to Busan is a 2016 South Korean action horror film directed by Yeon Sang-ho. The movie is about the characters getting trapped on a train where zombies climb up the train carts while they try to survie. The movie is pretty gorey and bloody with alot of jumpscares and vivd graphics and images. it is also a emotionally character driven thriller where unexpected events </p>
