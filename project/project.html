<p> 1) my brainstorming prosses was mostly on paper. I drew my prototype on paper and wrote down all the codes I would need to use. for example, the coding for creating a table. 
  <br>
2) I learned how to add links to pictures so when I clicked the images, it would take me to anotgher webpage. 
<br>
3) The hardest part of the project was adding the links to the images. 
<br>
4) To resolve this, I read over the examples to see what I did wring and corrected any typo's I made. 
<br>
5) one thing I changed after reciving peer feedback was the layout of my images. I centered them instead of keeping them the left 
<br>
6) I would probably change the banner but I couldnt because we had no time to make huge changes. 
<br>
7) The skills I learned through this project can help me in future jobs of web design and computer design. 
<br>
8) The part that was most fun for me was createing my table and costomizing my websites.
